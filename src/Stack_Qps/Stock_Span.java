    /*
    The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a series of N daily price quotes
    for a stock and we need to calculate span of stockâ€™s price for all N days.
    You are given an array of length N, where ith element of array denotes the price of a stock on
    ith. Find the span of stock's price on ith day, for every 1<=i<=N.
    A span of a stock's price on a given day, i, is the maximum number of consecutive days before
    the (i+1)th day, for which stock's price on these days is less than or equal to that on the
    ith day.
    Sample Input
    5
    30
    35
    40
    38
    35
    Sample Output
    1 2 3 1 1 END
    Explanation
    For the given case
    for day1 stock span =1
    for day2 stock span =2 (as 35>30 so both days are included in it)
    for day3 stock span =3 (as 40>35 so 2+1=3)
    for day4 stock span =1 (as 38<40 so only that day is included)
    for day5 stock span =1 (as 35<38 so only that day is included)
    hence output is 1 2 3 1 1 END
